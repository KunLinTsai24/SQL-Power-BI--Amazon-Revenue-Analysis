# Amazon-Revenue-Analysis

## Introduction

Amazon has been facing a notable decline in overall profitability and market competitiveness, with the underlying causes remaining unclear. To address this issue, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform, focusing on sales performance and product profitability. By tackling various **SQL** challenges, such as revenue analysis and product performance, and integrating these insights into a **Power BI dashboard**, I aimed to uncover actionable insights that can help the company regain its profitability and competitive edge.

## Business Requirement:

- **Revenue Trend Analysis:** By analyzing sales performance, the company can identify which products or categories are underperforming, understand sales trends, and adjust marketing or product strategies to boost sales.
- **Product Profitability Issues:** Focusing on product performance allows the company to identify which products are not meeting financial expectations

### 1. **Exploratory Analysis**

The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to understand the different order statuses within the dataset and examine the details associated with each status. This involves investigating orders that have been completed, are in progress, have been returned, or were canceled.

- Identification of Order Statuses:
  - The analysis started by identifying the distinct order statuses in the dataset (Completed, Inprogress, Returned, Cancelled).

- Detailed Examination of Each Status:
  - Completed Orders:
    - Example: Order ID 1
    - This order was placed, paid for, and successfully delivered. This provides a baseline for what a successful transaction looks like, showing no issues in payment, shipping, or return processes.

  - In-progress Orders:
    - Example: Order ID 15
    - This order is still in progress, with payment completed but the order is yet to be fully delivered. This could indicate potential delays or issues in the shipping process, which might contribute to customer dissatisfaction.

  - Returned Orders:
    - Example: Order ID 13
    - This order was placed and shipped, but it was returned, and a refund was issued. Understanding why returns occur is critical, as high return rates can indicate product quality issues, incorrect product descriptions, or customer dissatisfaction.
   
  - Cancelled Orders:
    - Example: Order ID 2
    - This order was canceled due to payment failure, and no shipping occurred. High cancellation rates could signal issues with the payment process, such as technical problems or customer hesitance at the payment stage.
- Result:
  - Completed orders and In-progress orders are defined as “Successful Sales” and total Revenue is defined as “Revenue”, since the payment is completed
  - Total Revenue in Returned orders are defined as “Return Loss Revenue”, since refund happened
  - Cancelled Orders rate in the past year should be analyzed

## **Conclusion**

### **Key Findings:**

The analysis highlighted a significant revenue decline from January to March 2024, primarily driven by underperformance in the Electronics category, with five specific Apple products contributing 67.54% to the decline. Additionally, a notable reduction in return loss revenue was observed in March, with the shipping provider Bluedart playing a significant role, contributing 81.52% to the overall decrease. However, July 2024 showed a positive trend with a 30% increase in revenue compared to the previous month, though revenue remained down 94% year-over-year.

### **Next Steps:**

To address the revenue decline and improve profitability, targeted promotions for the underperforming Apple products within the Electronics category are recommended. Strengthening partnerships with Bluedart and other key shipping providers can help further reduce return loss revenue. Additionally, the company should closely monitor order statuses, focusing on returned and canceled orders, to identify and rectify any systemic issues that may be contributing to customer dissatisfaction or operational inefficiencies.
